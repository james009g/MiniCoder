The `file_operations.py` file is a comprehensive module focused on handling file operations with several utility functions. Here's a detailed description of the file:

### Overview

This module provides several functions for file reading, writing, editing, and management operations, integrating robust error handling and user notifications via a console interface. It is designed to support operations on local files with considerations for security, file size, format, and content integrity.

### Key Components

1. **File Reading and Writing:**
   - **`read_local_file(file_path: str) -> str`**: Reads and returns the text content of a specified local file.
   - **`create_file(path: str, content: str)`**: Creates or overwrites a file with the given content, ensuring paths do not reference the home directory and that file size does not exceed 5MB.

2. **File Editing:**
   - **`apply_diff_edit(path: str, original_snippet: str, new_snippet: str)`**: Reads a file and replaces the first occurrence of a specified original snippet with a new snippet. It includes detailed error messages if snippets are not found or multiple occurrences exist.

3. **Path Normalization:**
   - **`normalize_path(path_str: str) -> str`**: Converts a path to an absolute form while checking for direct traversal vulnerabilities.

4. **Binary File Detection:**
   - **`is_binary_file(file_path: str, peek_size: int = 1024) -> bool`**: Determines whether a file is binary by inspecting a portion of its content for null bytes.

5. **Directory Management:**
   - **`add_directory_to_conversation(directory_path: str, conversation_history)`**: Scans a directory, adding non-excluded, text-based files to a conversation context for further processing.

6. **File Context Validation:**
   - **`ensure_file_in_context(file_path: str, conversation_history) -> bool`**: Ensures a file's content is in the conversation history, allowing for context validation in file operations.

### Additional Functionalities

- **Exclusion Mechanisms:** Excludes specific files and extensions during directory traversal to optimize performance and ensure security.
- **Console Interactions:** Uses the `console` object from the `rich` library to print formatted messages, providing instant feedback on operations.

### Usage Scenarios

This module is suited for applications requiring efficient and secure file and directory operations, especially in scenarios involving user interaction where clear notifications of success or failure of operations are necessary. It's particularly useful in environments that need to handle configuration files, scripts or documents, editing them safely and reliably.
